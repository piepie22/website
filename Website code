            Hi! I am Mandy Pieczynski and I am currently a Digita Media major at University of Central Florida.
            Some things to know about me are I used to be a theatre kid! So my creativity is very high. I love
            being creative and trying to make new things for people to enjoy! I am very outgoing and try my hardest to make
            everyoneâ€™s days just a little bit better if ever possible. I am also a huge animal lover so you may occasionally
            see posts dedicated to all types of animals. I really hope you enjoy scrolling along
            my page!
        </p>
